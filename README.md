# Customer Churn Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
Customer churn refers to customers who stop using a company’s service.  
This project predicts whether a customer will **churn or not** using historical customer data, enabling businesses to take proactive retention measures.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement
To build a supervised machine learning model that predicts customer churn based on customer tenure, billing information, contract type, and payment method.

---

## 🧠 Machine Learning Workflow
- Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Encoding categorical features  
- Feature scaling using StandardScaler  
- Model training using Logistic Regression  
- Model evaluation using standard classification metrics  
- Deployment using Streamlit  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn  
- **Model:** Logistic Regression  
- **Deployment:** Streamlit  
- **Tools:** VS Code, Jupyter Notebook
